## About me

I am a construction engineer by education. After studying I worked in engineering positions for more 13 years. Before my decision to change my professional activity, I worked for 10 years in the field of design and reconstruction of nuclear facilities. I worked his way up from an ordinary project-engineer to the head of building design department.

My work ceased to bring satisfaction, and I became interested in programming. I started by learning the basics of Python on my own, and then moved on to learning JavaScript. At first I studied on my own, but after a while I decided to take the "Frontend" course at RS School. During the training, many projects were made and many development technologies were considered.

My goal is to change profession and become a software developer. I have a great desire to learn and develop in the field of programming and IT technologies.
